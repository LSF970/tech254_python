# Make a dice roll game.

# Have the player and a cpu roll dice. Whoever's score is higher is the winner.

# Make sure to tally multiple dice rolls. First to a certain number is good.

# Make sure to use all that we have learned so far. Add in any info your know and do extra research.

# Be ready to explain your code next workday.

# Have fun with it! Use whatever setting you want (Be professional), and feel free to add more after you get the basic game working.
