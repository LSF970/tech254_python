# Make a battle game.

# The only rules are: It must CLI only (no GUI) and a winner must be declared.

# Make sure to use all that we have learned so far. Add in any info your know and do extra research.

# Be ready to explain your code next workday.

# Have fun with it! Use whatever setting you want (Be professional), and feel free to add more after you get the basic game working.
