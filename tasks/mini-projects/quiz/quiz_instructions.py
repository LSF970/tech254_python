# Make a interactive quiz game.

# Have the player answer questions. The output they get at the end should be determined by the answers they give.

# An example would be a Myer Briggs test for personality type.

# Make sure to use all that we have learned so far. Add in any info your know and do extra research.

# Be ready to explain your code next workday.

# Have fun with it! Use whatever setting you want (Be professional), and feel free to add more after you get the basic game working.
