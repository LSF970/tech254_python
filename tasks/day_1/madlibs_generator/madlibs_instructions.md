# Mad libs

This mini-project focuses on:

- Strings
- Variables
- Concatenation

Manipulate user input data as either an *adjective*, *pronoun* or *verb*. The program should take this data and arrange a story from it.

## Pseudocode

```python

# Create variables for words that will be inserted into sentences

# 3 nouns, 1 pronoun, 1 place, 1 adjective

# print a story, inserting the user inputted words where needed

# Use concatenation and fstrings/formatted strings!

# Feel free to go more complex with this! If you do, make sure to track your changes with Git!
```
