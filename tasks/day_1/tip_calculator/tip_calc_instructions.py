# Let's help with generating a bill with tips added and allow the user to split among a number of people

# Get the bill from the user

# Calculate the tip (assume a percentage of 10-15%)

# Calculate bill with the tip added

# Ask how many people they want to split with

# Calculate the bill divided by the split amount

# Print the split bill per person, being rounded to 2 decimal places - you will have to research how to display to 2 decimal places
